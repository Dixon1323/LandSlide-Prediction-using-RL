# LandSlide-Prediction-using-RL

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)

This project is focused on **predicting landslides** using machine learning, with potential experimentation in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** approaches. It combines traditional predictive modeling techniques like **XGBoost** with policy-based RL agents (e.g., PPO), suggesting a hybrid approach to spatiotemporal landslide forecasting.

## 🚀 Features

Key functionalities derived from the project structure:

- **Landslide Prediction Using Machine Learning**:
  - Utilizes trained models (e.g., `xgb_tuned_model.pkl`) to predict landslide risk based on features like rainfall, slope, soil type, etc.

- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**:
  - Includes reinforcement learning assets (e.g., `ppo_landslide_custom.zip`) that suggest exploration of policy optimization (possibly PPO) for adaptive landslide prediction or decision-making.

- **Dual Application Interfaces**:
  - Includes multiple entry points like `app.py` and `app_landslide.py` for launching the model or UI components.

- **Model Inference & Visualization**:
  - Potential to load pre-trained models and visualize predictions or insights from spatial-temporal datasets.

- **Modular Structure**:
  - Clearly separated application logic, models, and requirements for easier testing and scaling.

## ▶️ Usage

Depending on your goal, you may want to use either the ML-based or RL-based prediction system. Here’s a general guide:

### 🧠 Run XGBoost-based Prediction
```bash
python app.py
```

- Loads the `xgb_tuned_model.pkl` model and likely takes input parameters related to landslide risk features.
- May display results in CLI or UI (based on internal logic).

### 🤖 Run Reinforcement Learning-Based Agent (if implemented)
```bash
python app_landslide.py
```

- May initialize a trained PPO agent (`ppo_landslide_custom.zip`) for simulation-based prediction or decision-making.
- Some environments might require additional configuration.

> 💡 Explore both `app.py` and `app_landslide.py` to determine their functionalities.
